## [Unreleased]

### Added

- System clipboard on Wayland, through `wl_data_device`.
- Following dark mode and accent-color changes while the app runs, on Windows,
  macOS and Linux: `Event::ThemeChanged`, `Window::set_dark` and
  `Theme::follows_system`.
- window control: minimum and maximum size, maximize, fullscreen and the window
  icon (`App::min_size` & co., `WindowAttributes::with_*`, `AppHandle::window`)
  on X11, Wayland, Windows and macOS
- mouse cursor shapes (`CursorIcon`, `Element::cursor`): I-beam over text
  inputs, pointing hand over tap and drag targets, resize arrows and more
- Virtualized lists (`virtual_list`), tables (`table`: sortable, resizable
  columns, multi-selection, striped rows) and trees (`tree`), building only the
  rows on screen; see `docs/lists-and-tables.md` and `examples/tabledemo`.
- Accessibility roles for lists, tables, rows, cells, column headers, trees and
  tree items, with selected/expanded state; `Element::role`, `.selected()`,
  `.expanded()`.
- `Cx::scroll_offset` and `Cx::scroll_requests`, so a view can read a scroll
  container's offset and a handler can scroll it.
- `stipple::core::pointer()`: the pointer position, drag origin and the modifier
  keys held at the last button press (for Shift/Ctrl+click).
- A display-driven frame clock: `Cx::request_frame` and `Cx::frame_time` animate
  at the refresh rate (`wl_surface.frame`, `DwmFlush`, `CVDisplayLink`,
  `CADisplayLink`, a RandR-rate timer on X11) and stop when idle.
  `App::animating` reports whether a frame asked for another.
- The spinner turns, and hover and press highlights fade in and out.
- `asyncdemo` shows a spinner while its background work runs; its `--selftest`
  checks the spinner animated and then stopped.

### Changed

- `core::Role` and `platform::A11yRole` have new variants; `AccessNode` has
  `selected` and `expanded`; `Element` and `LayoutNode` have a `semantics`
  field.
- `spinner` takes the `Cx`: `spinner(cx, &theme)`.

### Fixed

- Pointer hit-testing respects clipping, so content scrolled out of a scroll
  container can't be clicked where it isn't drawn.

## [0.0.2](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/stipple/compare/stipple-v0.0.1...stipple-v0.0.2) - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- fix clippy chunks_exact_to_as_chunks lint (new in stable clippy)

### Other

- merge the toolkit into a single stipple crate
